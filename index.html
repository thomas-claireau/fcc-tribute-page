				<div class="title">Here's a time line of Roger Federer's life:</div>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>1993–1998 :</strong> Junior years. Federer's main accomplishments as
						a junior player came at Wimbledon in 1998, where he won both the boys'
						singles final over Irakli Labadze, and in doubles teamed with Olivier
						Rochus, defeating the team of Michaël Llodra and Andy Ram.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1998–2002 :</strong> Early professional career. Federer entered the
						top 100 ranking for the first time on 20 September 1999 and started at the
						1999 Marseille Open defeating the reigning champion of the 1998 French Open,
						Spaniard Carlos Moyá.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>2003 :</strong> Grand Slam breakthrough at Wimbledon. In 2003,
						Federer won his first Grand Slam singles title at Wimbledon, beating Andy
						Roddick in the semifinals and Mark Philippoussis in the final.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>2004 :</strong> Imposing dominance. During 2004, Federer won three
						Grand Slam singles titles for the first time in his career and became the
						first person to do so since Mats Wilander in 1988.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>2005 :</strong> Consolidating dominance. In 2005, Federer failed to
						reach the finals of the first two Grand Slam tournaments, losing the
						Australian Open semifinal to eventual champion Safin after holding match
						points, and the French Open semifinal to eventual champion Rafael Nadal.
					</li>

						<strong>2006 :</strong> Career-best season. The 2006 season was
						statistically the best season of Federer's career.

						all four Grand Slam singles finals, winning three of them again.
					</li>
					<li>

					<li>
						<strong>2010 :</strong> Fourth Australian Open. Federer started the year
						with a win at the Australian Open, where he defeated Andy Murray in the
						final, extending the Grand Slam singles record to sixteen titles and
						matching Andre Agassi's record of four Australian Open titles.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>2011 :</strong> Tour Finals title record. The year 2011 was a lean
						year for Federer, although great by most player's standards.

					<li>
						<strong>2012 :</strong> Wimbledon title, return to No. 1 and Olympic Silver.

						to No. 6.

						of 90 square inches to one measured at 97 square inches.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>2015 :</strong> 1,000th victory, Wimbledon & US Open finals. Federer
						started his season at the Brisbane International. He defeated Milos Raonic
						in the final, thereby becoming only the third man in the Open Era to have
						1,000 or more wins, joining Jimmy Connors and Ivan Lendl, as well as the
						first man in the Open Era to win at least one title in each of 15
						consecutive years.
					</li>
					<li>

					<li>
						<strong>2017 :</strong> Renaissance, Australian Open & Wimbledon titles.

						most titles since 2007, and the highest win percentage since 2006.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>2018 :</strong> 20th Major title and 310 weeks at No. 1. Federer
						started his season winning the Hopman Cup partnering with Belinda Bencic.
